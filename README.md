## UX
The Five Planes method - strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface - was used during the project planning phase to provide a conceptual framework for designing this short game.  The methodology for each plane is provided below. 

### Strategy
The strategy plane considers the website user's needs.

#### Target Audience
The target audience for *Emoji-Man* are those who:
- love basic computer games
- like the game PacMan
- enjoy retro 80's games
- enjoy variations and spin-offs of games
- love using emojis
- enjoy competing against others for a high score

#### User Stories
The user stories used to drive this project are detailed below:

EPICS:
Game play - the user can understand the game play, rules and launch the game
Leaderboard - the user can collect points and try and place themselves on the high score board
Health - the user can gain or lose health of their emojiman
Levels - the user can enjoy a variety of levels with progressing difficulty and unique themes
Accessibility - the user can easily navigate the website and enjoy the game on all screen sizes

The EPICS were further reduced to User Stories, which can be found in the [Issues](https://github.com/seanyoung247/emoji-man/issues) section of this repository.

### Scope
The Scope plane determines the scope of the project \
User Stories/Issues were mapped to Sprints (or Milestones) to plan for the current and next phase of the project.

The first sprints contained the higher priority features, providing basic website functionality to meet the project requirements (eg, allow users see a homepage and game map).  The later sprints contained features which were not considered necessary but enhanced the project (eg, enhance map themes, introduce sound effects).

Milestone 1: add homepage, create basic map, implement basic game functionality, create dictionaries to hold game date (emojis, maps)
Milestone 2: introduce moveable objects on the map, enhance maps for variety between levels, pull in info about different levels when a map is loaded
Milestone 3: introduce score and health, create game logic to increase/decrease score and health depending on collision with objects

User stories were designated both an EPIC label and a priority label (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have).  The priority labels ensured the team stayed aligned about which tasks to complete first on each milestone.  

User stories also had a list of tasks and acceptance criteria, to ensure it was clear when the user story was completed and acceptable to close. 

### Structure
The Structure plane was used to plan the organisation of website functionality and navigation, to provide a clear pathway to desired user actions.

- Navbar /
There is a main navigation bar at the top of the page in clear sight of the users, to allow them easy accessibility to all pages. 

- Game Section /
The main game section is always centered in the screen, which ensures the whole game is visible.

- Game Rules and reminders
Any reminders about value of tokens, objects to be avoided, and the user's score are displayed during the game, allowing them to check their progress.

### Skeleton
The Skeleton plane defines the form, presentation, and arrangement of components defined in the Structure. 

Initial wireframes were designed during the project proposal stage to mock-up the main website pages.  During development, these designs evolved to better suit the website content, but provided the team a framework to work from when designing the front-end.

#### Homepage

### Surface
The look and feel of the website was considered when designing the visual elements of the product, to produce a polished product which brings together all other UX planes.

#### Font
- [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P) from Google Fonts was chosen as the font for all in game text. Press Start 2P is based on the font for Namco's 1980s arcade machines - perfect for a homage to PacMan.

#### Colors
- Each game map has a foreground and background color, chosen based on the theme. For example the 'Vampire Party' level has black background with a blood red foreground, while the 'Walk the Plank' map has a dark aqua background and a cyan foreground to evoke the ocean. 

- The overall background of the site is black, with text in white. This is to achieve maximum contrast/legibility, and in keeping with the retro theme of the font and the game itself.

#### Sound effects
- An 80s 'chip tune' style piece of music and 8 bit style sound effects were chosen, in keeping with overall theme.

#### Buttons
- The buttons to select 'Home', 'Rules', 'Play' and 'Highscores' share the 'Press Start 2P' font and the black and white background/foreground with the rest of the game's text. This is to enhance the minimalistic 1980s feel.
